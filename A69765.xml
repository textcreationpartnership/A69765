            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE De≈øign which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>defence of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's Life</hi> profe≈ø≈øes that he had, in writing that part of his Book which relates to the Writings of the Primitive Fathers, and the Canon of the New Te≈øtament, was only to vindicate him≈øelf from the Charge of <hi>denying the Scripture and declaring his doubt that ≈øeveral pieces under the name of Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved now by the whole Chri≈øtian Church, are ≈øuppo≈øititious;</hi> by ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that what he had ≈øaid in the Life of <hi>Milton,</hi> concerning the ≈øpuriou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of <hi>≈øeveral pieces under the name of Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles,</hi> was meant not of tho≈øe Writings which are <hi>now received by the whole Chri≈øtian Church,</hi> but of tho≈øe Apocryphal Pieces,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95890:3"/>which were in many places received <hi>and approved in the Primitive Times.</hi> This is what the Author profe≈ø≈øes to be the only de≈øign of this part of his Book: And though for his own ≈øake I cannot but heartily wi≈øh it were really no other; yet becau≈øe there are ≈øeveral Pa≈ø≈øages, wherein he either ≈øo expre≈ø≈øes the very ≈ølight e≈øteem that he has for the Primitive Fathers, as ≈øeems to reflect upon our Religion it ≈øelf; or rai≈øes ≈øuch doubts about the authority of the Canon of the New Te≈øtament, as <hi>Hereticks</hi> (to u≈øe his own words) <hi>may draw mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous inferences</hi> from, and by which <hi>Scruples</hi> may be put into the minds of <hi>Sincere Chri≈øtians;</hi> I have therefore ≈øent you ≈øuch ≈øhort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks as upon reading the Book have occurred to me, and as I hope may be of ≈øome u≈øe to others on this Occa≈øion.</p>

            <p n="5">5.

            <p>And as to his ≈øaying that <hi>the Apo≈øtles before their Conver≈øion were the greate≈øt ≈øinners in nature;</hi> this does not at all <hi>rob us of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument we u≈øe to draw from their Integrity and Simplicity again≈øt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.</hi> For ≈øuppo≈øing them to have been never ≈øo wicked, were they the le≈øs <hi>Simple and Illiterate</hi> for that? Or is their Wickedne≈øs before their Conver≈øion any way incon≈øi≈øtent with their Integrity after it? But be≈øides, the≈øe Words might be ≈øpoken with relation to ≈øuch ≈øins, as though very great
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95890:15"/>in them≈øelves, yet ≈øincere and well-meaning Men might be guilty of in their Ignorance; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øays of him≈øelf, that before his Conver≈øion he was the <hi>chief of ≈øinners,</hi> in re≈øpect of his bla≈øphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chri≈øt and per≈øecuting Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans even to Death, for Chri≈øt's ≈øake.</p>
            <p>In ≈øhort, though it mu≈øt after all be confe≈øt, that the Authors of the≈øe Writings u≈øed a plain, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular and unpolite Stile; that they were guilty of ≈øome Mi≈øtakes, in things wherein the whole world at that time erred with them; (for which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> is plea≈øed to ≈øtile them <hi>Ignorant;</hi>) and that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered divers things, which tho' very agreeable to the ≈øtrictne≈øs of their Di≈øcipline in the Primitive Church, yet the pre≈øent times will not ≈øo well bear; (for which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> calls them <hi>Super≈øtitious;</hi>) Tho' I ≈øay, all this mu≈øt be granted;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95890:16"/>yet ≈øince in general the Matter of the≈øe Writings is ≈øuch, that not only the Ancients thought fit to cite them in their Books and read them in their Churches, but al≈øo the Learned≈øt and mo≈øt Judicious Criticks of our own times, as well Laicks as tho≈øe of the Clergy, have received them as genuine, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended them as <hi>containing the true and pure Faith of Chri≈øt;</hi> I cannot but think that the very great ≈øcorn and contempt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath thought fit to treat them, is a very bold a≈ø≈øum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him≈øelf, and undervaluing the Judgment of the greate≈øt Men both of the Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Church, and con≈øequently a Reflection upon our Religion its ≈øelf; and that after all, we have very <hi>good Rea≈øon,</hi> as well as very <hi>great Authority,</hi> though not to receive the≈øe Writings as of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95890:16"/>the ≈øame Authority with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Books of the New Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet to pay them a <hi>proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Veneration,</hi> both with re≈øpect to the <hi>Authors</hi> and to the <hi>Writings</hi> them≈øelves.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Neither the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Genuinene≈øs of the≈øe Writings, nor the re≈øpect paid to them as ≈øuch, does in the lea≈øt dimini≈øh from the Authority of the New Te≈øtament, or tend to make the number of the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Books uneertain or precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>This is the difficulty, on which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ≈øeems particularly to in≈øi≈øt, as if it were impo≈ø≈øible for tho≈øe who believe the Genuinene≈øs of the≈øe Writings to give any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rea≈øon why they do not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them into the Canon of the New Te≈øtament, as well as ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

            <p n="1">1.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95890:18"/>all other Chri≈øtian Churches, into the Canon of Scripture; and ≈øo have been continued ever ≈øince by univer≈øal con≈øent, and by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted Succe≈ø≈øion of Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in all Ages. Whereas of tho≈øe Writings which we are now ≈øpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of, that which is the lea≈øt controverted, <hi>viz.</hi> the Epi≈øtle of <hi>Clemens,</hi> was for many Ages thought to be utterly lo≈øt: and though upon its appearing again, the be≈øt Criticks in the World thought they had <hi>good rea≈øon</hi> to pronounce it <hi>Genuine;</hi> yet they could not be ≈øo ≈øure that it was free from corruption and interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as we are of tho≈øe Writings which were never lo≈øt. And now this Argument is of peculiar force again≈øt Mr. <hi>T.</hi> For if he thinks, as he ≈øays, that he can with all the ea≈øe in the World prove the≈øe Writings ≈øpurious; (which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95890:18"/>his vain boa≈øt, he will never be able to perform;) he may at lea≈øt allow tho≈øe, who do not doubt but they are Genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, yet not to advance them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their own rank, and place them among tho≈øe which by the Univer≈øal Church have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Canon of the New Te≈øtament.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the≈øe Writings be ≈øuch, as that they do therefore de≈øerve very great veneration and re≈øpect; yet is there plainly ≈øomething <hi>humane,</hi> ≈øomething of <hi>infirmity,</hi> ≈øomething of <hi>fallibility</hi> in them, for which they are with all rea≈øon thought inferior to the Writings of the Apo≈øtles. And this Argument is al≈øo peculiarly ≈øtrong again≈øt Mr. <hi>T.</hi> For if he thinks, as he ≈øays, that he can with all the ea≈øe in the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95890:19"/>World ≈øhow the <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øtition</hi> of the Authors of the≈øe Writings; well may he allow tho≈øe, who ≈øo far differ from him in this, as to think they de≈øerve the high Character of Primitive, Holy, and Apo≈øtolical Men, yet not to pre≈øume to equal them with the Apo≈øtles them≈øelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When we have made the be≈øt judgment of things, that we can po≈ø≈øibly at this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance of time, we cannot after all but pay ≈øome deference to the judgment of the Ancients, e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when a≈ø≈øembled in a Council; and allow them to judge ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what better in the Ages next after our Saviour, what Writings were of Authority to be made the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard and Rule of Faith, than we can after 1700 hundred years: E≈øpecially ≈øince of the doubted

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Therefore, and which is a direct deci≈øion of this Que≈øtion, I add, that the true rea≈øon why ≈øuch a certain and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate number of Writings are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as the Canon of Scripture, that is, as an Authoritative Rule of Faith and Manners, is becau≈øe they were <hi>written by the Apo≈øtles them≈øelves,</hi> (who are acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been guided by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Spirit,) or which is all one,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95890:20"/>were <hi>dictated, reviewed and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them or ≈øome of them.</hi> All the Books of the New Te≈øtament, except the Go≈øpels of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and the <hi>Acts of the Apo≈øtles,</hi> are therefore received as Canonical, becau≈øe the Church upon undoubted Grounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves them to be <hi>written immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by the Apo≈øtles them≈øelves;</hi> and the≈øe three Books are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore received as Canonical like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe, becau≈øe we believe them to have been <hi>dictated, reviewed and approved by ≈øome of the Apo≈øtles.</hi> And this is a plain and direct rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, though Mr. <hi>T.</hi> is ≈øo mode≈øt to ≈øay <hi>he never heard</hi> of it,
<note place="margin">pag. 48.</note> why the Writings of St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St. <hi>Luke,</hi> who were only Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Apo≈øtles, are received among the Canonical Writings of the Apo≈øtles; and yet the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles of <hi>Clemens</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95890:20"/>were Fellow-labourers with the Apo≈øtles, are not. And that this is indeed the true rea≈øon, why ≈øome Books are received as of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Authority, and others not; may be ≈øufficiently proved to any unprejudiced per≈øon, from what we find in the Ancients concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this matter. That <hi>all Books ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be written by the Apo≈øtles, were always received as of unque≈øtionable Authority,</hi> is evident. The Que≈øtion concerning any doubted Book, being, not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Writing of an Apo≈øtle ≈øhould be received as of good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or not, but whether that Writing ≈øaid to be an Apo≈øtle's, were indeed the Writing of him who≈øe name it bore.

            <p>The Truth is, the unque≈øtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Works of the Apo≈øtles were not anciently (as Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øes) kept in a di≈øtinct Book from the Apocryphal, but read and cited promi≈øcou≈øly with the Works of their immediate Succe≈ø≈øors: But then 'tis al≈øo certain, that as unque≈øtioned Works of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles, <hi>whenever</hi> they were cited were looked upon by all as infallible and deci≈øive; ≈øo the other Pieces, whil≈øt they were quoted and urged by ≈øome, might as freely be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied or not yielded to by others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:95890:23"/>Vainly therefore doth Mr. <hi>T.</hi> object, <hi>That they who believe the Epi≈øtle of</hi> Clemens <hi>and</hi> the re≈øt <hi>to be genuine, cannot give any rea≈øon why they do not admit it into the Canon of Scripture.</hi> And as fal≈øly does he in≈øinuate, that the E≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhment of that Canon is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and precarious. Could it be proved, <hi>That the Epi≈øtles of</hi> James <hi>and of</hi> Peter, <hi>and of</hi> Jude, <hi>or any of them, were not written by tho≈øe who≈øe Names they bear;</hi> we ≈øhould indeed be obliged to reject them: And could the <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Peter</hi> be proved to be genuine, we ≈øhould be obliged to receive them into the Canon of the New Te≈øtament.

            <p>What Mr. <hi>T.</hi> has invidiou≈øly urged about the Divi≈øions among the Fathers, and their want of exactne≈øs in their Rea≈øonings, I ≈øuppo≈øe will not move tho≈øe, who know that Truth is never the le≈øs ≈øuch for being ≈øurrounded with a multitude of Errors; and that Men did not then write in a Nice and Schola≈øtick way, but in a plain and unpolite Stile, mixing
